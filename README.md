### Description
We develop the Spiking Coding Network theory for estimation and control. The resulting networks work as a spiking equivalent of a linear–quadratic–Gaussian
controller. We demonstrate robust spiking control of simulated spring-mass-damper and cart-pole systems, in the face of several perturbations, including input- and system-noise, system disturbances, and neural silencing. As our approach does not need learning or optimization, it offers opportunities for deploying fast and efficient task-specific on-chip spiking controllers with biologically realistic activity.
