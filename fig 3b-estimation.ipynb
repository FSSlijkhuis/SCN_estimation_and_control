    "# Figure 3b: Estimation\n",
    "In this Notebook, we shall create a plot showing the estimation performed through a Spike Coding Network (SCN). The plot shows the estimated states of the SCN Kalman filter, as well as the actual Spring-Mass-Damper (SMD) dynamical system which the SCN estimator is estimating. The work in this notebook is carried out for \"Closed-form control with spike coding networks\" by F.S. Slijkhuis, S.W. Keemink and P. Lanillos (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.12887)."
